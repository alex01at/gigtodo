**History:**
From 2018 to 2021, the script was available for purchase on CodeCanyon and Codester. The company Pixinal Studio acquired it from ***Perola Hammar.***

Since he didn't want to develop the original codebase further, I took full ownership of all rights to make it a free open-source script.
